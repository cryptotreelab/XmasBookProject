# CryptotreeLabs History & Future



In the middle of December of 2020, we dreamed about a future that nobody chopping trees for Christmas celebrations. And we started the XmasBook project that we put for sale on 22 Dec of 2020. XmasBook is a Crypto collectible with so many cool features that some may enjoy casting their NFT on TV as a replacement for a real or plastic tree, to celebrate the Christmas spirit without killing young trees or consuming plastic.

As we dove into the problem size of this problem shook us. there are reports that said more than 100 millions spruce were getting farm and chopped for Christmas celebration globally , you can read more about the environmental impact of Christmas trees here https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/christmas-tree-environmental-impact/)

we believe we may make a progress in the direction of better Christmas nights and this project brings us so much joy and passion. So we did not let the project go and we kept working on the new idea so everybody can make their own Xmas NFT.there is still so much work left to do and there is a long road ahead of us.

We are making different variations of a Xmas Tree Engine, that finally enables people to easily make Xmas NFT for themselves or their friends or even design crypto collectible or a series of fun NFTmemes, NFTArts, videos, gifs... for bringing Christmas tree farming momentum to Xmas NFTs that is much more sustainable and better experience than a dead tree in the living room.
We even used Xmas engine to make an introduction video for XmasBook Project:

As an example, we made the Xmas Tree metafest edition :)

As we are speaking Xmas Engine has an elementary interface, here you can see how the Xmas Tree metafest edition was made.

These are the only necessary data for creating Xmas Tree metafest edition.
In the near future you can encode this that to your NFT like this:
Encoded image NFT data  = [meta sky,1,120,0,0,0,9,0,yes,,,,, ;
Fraser Fir,1,110,960,540,0,8,0,,,,,, ;
metafest octapus,1,30,980,200,0,4,0,,,,,, ;
metafest logo,1,20,0,0,0,8,0,yes,,,,,]
With this, we can guarantee the Xmas NFT composition immutability.

We know that the path we chose is a long one but we will make everything better and better till a community of believer start to celebrate Christmas in a new fashion.
